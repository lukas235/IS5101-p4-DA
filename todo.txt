- calculate as much meaningful information as you can about the dataset
- write a report detailing and justifying the conclusions you have extracted
 - section: comprehensive description of the dataset
- indicate & justify whether you accept or reject each of the provided hypotheses
 -> BUT analysis should not be limited to them
 
- consider including visualisations
- make reasonable assumptions

- indicate as concisely as possible any information you can statistically justify about the dataset & which is genuinely useful or interesting (to the researchers)
- you can include negative conclusions i.e. lack of relationship you might have expected, as long as useful



More hypos?

Calculate
1. Dataset
X number of participants
X m/f
X age mean + std dev
X nationalities total count
X avg. inputted faults separate in A and B -> faults per minute ...

Rows & Cols
what do the different cols do
(how were the values computed, if interesting)

2. Hypotheses
X time std-dev & mean locate fault
X time std-dev & mean type fault descr
X> t-test
X> f-test

X fit with normal dist


3. Extended
 X) ggplot
 X) find significant difference between reporting error rates
 c) find significant difference in text typing error rates
 ---
 d) find correlations
  - age-accuracy/speed...
  - nationality
  - m/f
  - learning effect
  - speed and correctness

4. If still time:



 
Hyp: MapA is more precise than MapB in terms of finding the location
Hyp: There is no difference in the precision when typing text





regressions
relationships: correlation
t-tests/F-test


t-test:
as we cannot assume a-priori that one condition is better than the other, we will run a 2-tailed test


# Investigate the effect of age on survival
> t.test( subset(data, Survived == 1)$Age, subset(data, Survived == 0)$Age )

> # Ratio of men vs. women who survived?
> nrow( subset(data, Sex=="male" & Survived == 1) )
[1] 109

> nrow( subset(data, Sex=="female" & Survived == 1 ) )
[1] 233

> nrow( subset(data, Sex=="male" & Survived == 1) ) / nrow( subset(data, Survived == 1) )
[1] 0.3187135

> nrow( subset(data, Sex=="female" & Survived == 1) ) / nrow( subset(data, Survived == 1) )
[1] 0.6812865





Questions:
1. does it make sense to comapare groupsindividually 1before2 &vv
2. do we have to describe the experiment?
